## my build of dwm, the tiling wm that sucks less
- `dwm` is an elegant, minimalist, enthusiast x11 window manager that sucks less.
- configured entirely through modifying the source code, `dwm` is a blast to sift through, and teaches you tons about `c`.

## patches
- dwm-cool_autostart
    - patch that implements autostart functionality controllable through `config.def.h`
- dwm-fullgaps
    - patch that adds controllable gaps between windows

## statusbar
- standard `dwm` bar
- using `dwmblocks-async` for status information
